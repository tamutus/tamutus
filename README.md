###  Board Member at Moneyless Society

### 🤝 I am always looking for people to help me make Magnova into the thing it is framed to become.

Much of the broad engineering has been done, but much remains to be done in the way of:
- Refactoring for a framework like Sveltekit, Next, or Nuxt.
- UI
- routing
- task management UX
- backend logic
- integration with likeminded platforms
- security audits and suggestions
- moving what's in my brain to code on github

## Plug into my network
👩‍💻 Contact me [by email](mailto:them@lavrat.space) if you want to be a part of creating tools that could crowdsource and streamline direct action towards common interests, or if you have other skills that could lead to this project taking off, such as experience starting co-ops/NPOs. 

## 🔮 Future projects: 
- a co-op digital shop that will interact with the Magnova API to link goods to direct action they can be used for, tracking environmental benefits/harms of things we create, and submitting open source production guides to Magnova to power an open-source gift economy of the future.
- blog/forum site contract for owner of Veritas Divining
- Ballots Unleashed – a ranked choice voting platform channeling zcal's directness and focus, with tangible benefits to friends, family, communities, organizations, and locations at varying administrative levels.
- Dice Funk website – probably? to accompany the podcast hosted by Austin Yorski
